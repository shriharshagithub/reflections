This is my third reflection prompt 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: Create the duplicate repository in the GitHub 

Clones: Create a duplicate repository of any repository in our local machine

Branch: create a branch of to push pull

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be a nightmare
